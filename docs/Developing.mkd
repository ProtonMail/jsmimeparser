Developing
==========

JSMime is intended to rely only on HTML 5 Web APIs and ES 6 as external
requirements for its development. However, these are still a work in progress,
and thus support for them may vary from browser to browser or among different
rendering engines. Polyfilling may be necessary to get this to work, but
polyfills should only be present in test framework code and not in the main source or test files themselves.
